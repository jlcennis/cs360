The inventory monitoring application's goal is to assist users in regularly updating inventories for businesses. Three screens make up the inventory application: login, item list, and inventory update. The inventory application is for users who require it for their businesses to ensure real-time inventory updates to prevent discrepancies in inventory.
The following screens were required: login, home, inventory list, inventory editing, and permissions. This made the software simple to use by giving each screen a primary function. My designs gave users a straightforward and approachable interface to interact with in order to keep users in mind. The purpose of the screens and how to use them are both crystal clear. My designs were effective because they carried out their functions. Users like the designs since they are simple to understand and simple to interact with.
Both the design and the coding for the application were created iteratively. In order to design my inventory application, I used the knowledge and abilities I learned from the course materials and the developer.android.com website. How to correctly comprehend and utilize Android Studio was covered in the book and on the developer.android.com website.
Running and testing the code allowed us to confirm that it was working and free of errors. This is crucial to prevent any application security flaws of any kind. To test the code and determine whether the application was functioning properly, the Android Studio provided a debugger tool.
I have to get creative with the database systems. I required an adjustable item that wouldn't be too difficult to change. It took quite a while, but once it did, I wanted to be able to verify that item amounts could be increased or decreased, as well as eliminated entirely.
The UI, in my opinion, was where I most effectively displayed my abilities. Although I think there is potential for improvement, I think the UI is rather simple and clear.
